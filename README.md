👋 Hi, I’m @HARSH-PANDEY

DevOps Engineer with 3+ years of experience designing, automating, and managing secure AWS cloud infrastructures. I specialize in building scalable CI/CD pipelines and have led successful automation initiatives using Jenkins integrated with GitHub, significantly improving deployment speed and reliability.

I have hands-on experience deploying containerized applications using Docker, EKS, and Fargate, along with strong proficiency across AWS services such as EC2, S3, CloudFormation, IAM, and CloudWatch. 
My work includes cost optimization, performance tuning, and enforcing security best practices through proactive monitoring and vulnerability scanning with AWS Inspector.

I’m passionate about building efficient, secure, and scalable cloud environments—and continuously improving DevOps workflows through automation, observability, and collaboration.
